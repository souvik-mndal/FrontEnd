## HTML
The following projects were created using **only HTML** to understand its various elements and structure:  

###  1. Tribute Page  
A tribute page dedicated to **Linus Torvalds**, created using HTML. Learned many new elements like `<q>`, `<blockquote>`, `<cite>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, and more.
