## HTML
The following projects were created using **only HTML** to understand its various elements and structure:  

###  1. Tribute Page  
A tribute page dedicated to **Linus Torvalds**, created using HTML. Learned many new elements like `<q>`, `<blockquote>`, `<cite>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, and more.

## CSS
The following projects were created using **only HTML and CSS** to understand its various elements and structure:  
###  1. Parallax Website
### Parallax Website  
Created a **parallax scrolling website** using HTML and CSS. While building this, I learned several new concepts:  

- **Perspective & Z-axis**: Used to create a depth effect by positioning elements in 3D space.  
- **`transform-style: preserve-3d`**: Ensures child elements maintain their 3D transformations.  
- **`background-attachment: fixed`**: Keeps the background image fixed while scrolling, creating a smooth parallax effect.  

This project helped me understand **how to work in 3D space with CSS** and enhance user experience with immersive scrolling effects.
